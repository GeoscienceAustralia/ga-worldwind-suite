<h2>Installation guide</h2>

<p>Ok, so you've ended up here.  You want to know how to get it running.  I'll tell you how...</p>

<p>First, get a chicken.  Then, take 5 black candles and a pentagram.  Light
up the candles and put the chicken on the pentagram... nah, I'm only kidding.
 There's not much work to do, and no chickens, candles or pentagrams involved.
 There's no fee either.</p>

<p>First of all you need a bit of time.  Don't rush this installation process
unless you're a professional and can figure out how everything works just
by looking at the code behind it all.  You'd also want to make sure you have
some basic HTML skills, know what a frameset are and how they work.</p>

<p>This installation guide will go through the following items:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="frameset.shtml">The frameset</a></li>
  <li><a href="options.shtml">Setting options</a></li>
  <li><a href="the-menu.shtml">Making the menu</a></li>
  <li><a href="icon-menu.shtml">The icon menu</a></li>
  <li><a href="tracking-code.shtml">Tracking code</a></li>
  <li><a href="css-properties.shtml">CSS properties used by the menu</a></li>
</ul>
