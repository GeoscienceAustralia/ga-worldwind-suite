<h2>Checking the menu's icons</h2>

<p>Before you finish up there's some icons that need your attention.  First
of all you'd want to have a look into the directory with menu images, particularly
the file "menu_link_default.gif".  The image with that filename is what will
be shown if you do not specify an icon in the menu, or if the item's URL
doesn't match any entry in the icon list.  On my site I have a document-like
icon, but you can change it to whatever you like.</p>

<p>Then there's the icon list. If you're happy with how the menu works already
there's no need to alter it. You can instead read about how to add the <a href="tracking-code.shtml">tracking code</a> to the whole site. Those curious about how to define icons read on.</p>

<p>When the menu system tries to determine what icon a regular item should
have it first checks whether you specified one in the menu.  If you didn't
specify any it checks each item's URL against the icon list to see if there
are any matches.  If no match was found the item gets the default icon. 
With the icon list you'll be able to change icons depending on quite a lot
of things. Let's have a look at what the icon list looks like by default:</p>

<pre><code>var MTMIconList = null;
MTMIconList = new IconList();
MTMIconList.addIcon(new MTMIcon("menu_link_external.gif", "http://", "pre"));
MTMIconList.addIcon(new MTMIcon("menu_link_pdf.gif", ".pdf", "post"));
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see it looks more or less like a menu.  That's intentional.
 The list contains items specifying the icon to be used, what you should
try to find in the item's URL, and what kind of match we're looking for.
In other words each line looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>MTMIconList.addIcon(new MTMIcon(filename, match, type));</code></pre>

<p>If we look at the first icon we add to the icon list it has the filename
"menu_link_external.gif".  This is a picture of a globe. "match" is set to
"http://" and type to "pre" (as in "prefix").  The two latter variables tell
the script to look for "http://" at the beginning of the item's URL.  The
search for a match is <em>case-sensitive</em>, so "http://" will not match
"HTTP://".  The idea behind this icon list entry is that all URLs that point
to external web-sites get the globe icon.  Type "pre" can therefore be used
when you want all menu items pointing to a specific site, or using a specific
protocol (e.g. "ftp://") to have the same icon.</p>

<p>The next icon we add is of type "post", which means that we look for "match"
at the end of the menu item's URL.  In this case we look for ".pdf" which
is the file extention for PDF (Portable Data Format) documents.  Type "post"
therefore enables you to assign icons to menu items depending on their file
extention or other matches at the end of their URL.</p>

<p>There is also another type available, but it isn't used in the default
icon list.  This type is "any".  It means that as long as the menu item's
URL contains "match" it will use the specified icon.  This can for instance
be used to give all menu items that point to the same directory the same
icons.</p>

<p>In other words, this is a powerful thing making you easily able to change
icons for many menu items by only changing or adding one line to the icon
list.  Remember to change the list so it suits your needs.</p>

<p>Now it's on to the last part of the installation guide, <a href="tracking-code.shtml">tracking code</a>.</p>
