Morten's JavaScript Tree Menu was originally a slightly modified version
of Mike Hall's JavaScript Tree Menu as found on his web site in October, 1998.
Development of his version has since discontinued, but his web site remains
online at http://www.brainjar.com/

Most of the code and the concepts of the current version have, not
surprisingly, been created by Morten Wang.

In addition to the specific contributions mentioned here I'd like to thank
all the people who have contributed either on the mailing list or through
private emails.  The positive feedback, constructive criticism and suggestions
I've received are too many to list each of them, but they're the reason I keep
on enjoying this project.  Thank you!

Version 2.3.0: 

  The code needed to add the ability to control expansion as well as separate
  icons for closed & open state of sub menus was provided by Arthur Veinstein.

  The patch needed to make tracking work when navigating local files in
  Microsoft Internet Explorer was provided by both Bill Lange
  and David Favis-Mortlock.

Version 2.3.1:

  Ray Donovan
	Fix for URLs starting with "/"
  Patric Eriksson
	Scrollbar colour code, right-click prevention code and ideas, code
	and assistance on the linked .js file issue.
  John Russell
	Pointed out that code.html missed a DOCTYPE and suggested that the menu
	should have configurable doctype and content-type elements as well as
        an option for default target.  Has also been helpful in testing
	development versions of the menu and identifying any bug that showed up.
  Lisa Hagin
	Right-click prevention code
  Oswald Jaskolla
	Making MTMenuFrame a pointer to the frame object instead of a string
  Phillip Feichko
	Pointed out that there should be a possibility to also store the
	tracked item in a cookie and then load the saved document.
  William Denniss
	Suggested and submitted patch for MTMakeLastSubmenu() to simplify
	menu building by removing the need for the items[] array.
	The function has been added to the MTMenu() object as .makeLastSubmenu()
  Tim Davies
	The idea & code for an option naming the frame containing code.html
  Paul Carrielies
	Supplied a patch for function MTMAddSubItem() which lets you add an
	item to another item's submenu without knowing whether it has said
	submenu or not.  The function has been added to the MTMenuItem()
	object as .addSubItem()
  Peter Stamfest
	Suggested option MTMAlwaysLinkIfWE and supplied a patch for adding
	this option to the code base.
  Sachin Ghaisas and Chris Coulthrust
	Function MTMakeSVG() which shows how to use SVGs instead of GIF images
	in the menu.
  Martin Rubas
	Ideas and code for parts of the MTMBrowser() object with regards to
	browser detection.
  Ganesh Babu
	Identified a bug in the expansion argument to MTMakeSubemenu() and
	helped test the bug fix.
  Eric Desart
	Improved image compression in the images used by the menu, thereby
	saving both disk space and bandwidth.

  Kristian M Bjerke
	Checked through the list of sites in use as well as all submitted
	sites giving that part of the web site a long overdue update.
  John Russell
	Massive amounts of testing and follow ups of bug fixes.

Version 2.3.2-macfriendly
