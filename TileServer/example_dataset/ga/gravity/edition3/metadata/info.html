<h2 align="center">GRAVITY ANOMALY MAP OF THE AUSTRALIAN REGION<br />
3rd Edition, 2008</h2>
<p><b>EXPLANATORY NOTES:</b><br> This image is derived from
observations recorded at approximately 1.4 million gravity stations held
in the Australian National Gravity Database (ANGD) by Geoscience
Australia (GA), and free-air gravity anomaly data derived from satellite
altimetry by Sandwell and Smith (1997) over marine areas. The onshore
data were aquired by the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments,
the mining and exploration industry, universities and research
organisations from the 1950s to the present day. Continental Australia
has a basic station spacing coverage of 11 kilometres, with South
Australia, Tasmania and part of New South Wales covered at a spacing of
7 kilometres. Victoria has station coverage of approximately 1.5
kilometres. Recent Federal, State and Territory Government initiatives
have funded systematic infill at a grid station spacing of 2, 2.5 or 4
kilometres to provide improved coverage in areas of scientific or
economic interest. Other areas of detailed coverage have been surveyed
by private companies for exploration purposes. Over the continental
region only open file data as held in the ANGD at May 2008 were used in
the creation of the grid. The diagram below shows the distribution of
these onshore stations. Data derived from satellite altimetry were used
over the marine region.

<p>In both images spherical cap Bouguer gravity anomalies are shown
onshore while free-air anomalies are shown offshore. The gravity
anomalies are based on the Australian Absolute Gravity Datum 2007 and
1994 Geodetic Datum of Australia (Tracey et al., 2008).</p>
<p>The onshore Bouguer gravity anomalies were calculated using a
density of 2.67 tm&#713;&sup3;. Offshore free-air gravity anomalies were
based on gravity (V16.1) and topography (V9.1) data extracted from the
Marine Gravity from Satellite Altimetry dataset (Sandwell and Smith,
1997, 2005). These data were combined with the GA onshore gravity data
and gridded using a variable density gridding technique provided by the
INTREPID Geophysics software package. The data were gridded to a cell
size of 800 metres using Lambert Conic Conformal Projection coordinates
with standard parallels of 18&deg; and 36&deg; south and a central
meridian of 134&deg; east.</p>
<p>The large image shows Bouguer gravity anomalies onshore and
free-air gravity anomalies offshore after applying a high-pass filter
with a cut-off wavelength of 500 kilometres. The image below is of the
gravity data without the application of the filter.</p>

	width="611" height="351"></p>
<p>In both the large and small images, to emphasize the expression
of subtle anomalies, an artificial sun-angle &ldquo;illumination&rdquo;
from the northeast was used to modify both the saturation and intensity
of the original colour image.</p>
<p>The geodetic version of the grid used for the preparation of the
image and the original onshore point located data are available online
