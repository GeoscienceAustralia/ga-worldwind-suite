<h2 align="center">MAGNETIC ANOMALY MAP OF AUSTRALIA<br />
  5th Edition, 2009</h2>
<p><b>PREFACE:</b><br>
This edition of the Magnetic Anomaly Map of Australia includes an additional 115 individual survey grids since the fourth edition was published in 2004 (Milligan and Franklin, 2004). New independent airborne total-field magnetic data acquired in 2007 during a continental calibration survey flown as part of the Australian Government&rsquo;s Onshore Energy Security Program have been used to increase the accuracy of intermediate wavelengths. The method of matching the individual survey grids has also been updated. 795 individual grids have been matched and merged into the composite used to produce this image, with the resolution of each grid optimal for the specifications of the source survey line data. These grids include data from many new surveys, acquired mainly by the State and Territory geological surveys. It is estimated that 27 million line-kilometres of survey data were acquired to produce the grid data, 8 million line-kilometres more than for the fourth edition.</p>
<p><b>EXPLANATORY NOTES:</b><br>
This image  was compiled from Total Magnetic Intensity survey data held in the National  Airborne Geophysical Database by Geoscience Australia. The image is a composite of data  acquired from surveys flown by Geoscience Australia and surveys flown under  contract to Geoscience Australia, the State and Territory geological surveys in  either separate or joint projects and the private sector. The source data are  used with their permission. The data from these surveys were acquired at a  range of line spacing&rsquo;s (see <a href="#SourceDia">source diagrams</a>), flying heights, and measurement  accuracies (Percival, 2010).</p>
<p>The data  supplied by the New South Wales Department of Industry and Investment;  Department of Resources, Minerals and Energy Northern Territory; Queensland Department  of Mines and Energy; Department of Primary Industries and Resources South  Australia; Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources Tasmania;  Department of Primary Industries Victoria and Department of Mines and Petroleum  Western Australia (see source diagram) were acquired at an altitude of 100 m or  less along lines spaced 500 m apart or less.</p>
<p>For each  survey, the International Geomagnetic Reference Field for the relevant epoch  was removed, and a grid created with a cell size of approximately one fifth of  the line spacing, using the minimum curvature method of Briggs (1974). Some  grids were subjected to micro-levelling (Minty, 1991). The gridded data from  all the surveys were joined together using a two-stage method, based on the  data differences in the overlap regions between adjacent surveys. Initially, a  base-shift was applied to each survey to minimise the global set of differences  between adjacent surveys. An iterative process was then applied, removing a  plane surface from selected surveys to minimise the differences between it and  its neighbours. During this iterative process, the base levels of those grids  that overlapped with an independent dataset, the Australia-wide Airborne  Geophysical Survey (AWAGS) were constrained by the AWAGS data to increase the  accuracy of the intermediate wavelength information (Milligan et al., 2009;  Minty et al., 2003). Remaining high-frequency differences between the grids  were smoothed out using a convolution operator. The final grid was created by  interpolating all of the data into one grid, with a cell size of 3 seconds of  arc (approximately 80 m), which was then reprojected to the Lambert Conformal  Conic Projection with a cell size of 250 m.</p>
<p>The image  was generated from the natural colour palette (magenta high&ndash;blue low) using  histogram equalisation. To emphasize the expression of short-wavelength  anomalies, an artificial illumination was applied from the northeast. The  output of the sun-angle image was used to modulate colour intensity and  saturation of the initial colour image in the Hue, Saturation, Value colour space  (Milligan et al., 1992).</p>
<p>Three of  the small images below represent example transformations of the composite grid;  the transformed data are available from Geoscience Australia. Also shown is an image of an  improved lithospheric magnetic field model to degree 120 (~333 km) at the  Earth&rsquo;s surface derived from the MF6 CHAMP satellite (Maus et al., 2007).</p>
