<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Geoscience Australia's World Wind Viewer is an application developed using   NASA's World Wind Java Software Development Kit (SDK) to display Australia's   continental data sets. The viewer allows you to compare national data sets such   as the radioelements, the gravity and magnetic anomalies, and other mapping   layers, and show the data draped over the Australian terrain in three   dimensions.</p>
<p>When you first start the 3D Data Viewer you will see the following default screen</p>
<p><img src="../images/Getting_Started_image001.jpg" alt="Initial Opening Screen" width="540" height="405" /></p>
<h3>Turning layers on/off</h3>
<p>Click on the <img src="../images/box_checked.png" alt="Check Box" width="13" height="13" /> check box next to a layer to turn the layer on or off. Some layers such as the <strong>Landsat</strong> layer are only visible when you get closer to the globe.</p>
<h3>Expanding and Collapsing Collections</h3>
<p>Click on the <img src="../images/button_collapse.png" alt="Collapse Button" width="9" height="9" /> minus button next to a Collection in the Layers or Datasets panels to collapse the collection. </p>
<p>Click on the  <img src="../images/button_expand.png" alt="Collapse Button" width="9" height="9" /> plus button next to a collapsed Collection to expand it. <br />
  <img src="../images/Getting_Started_image002.jpg" alt="Collapse the Standard Menu" width="385" height="196" /> </p>
<h3>Add Layers from Datasets to the Layers panel</h3>
<p>Only layers in the Layers panel are able to be viewed in the Data Viewer. Layers can be added by clicking on the <img src="../images/button_add.png" alt="Add Layer button" width="16" height="16" align="texttop" /> Add Layer button next to a layer in the Datasets panel. Layers can also be added to the Layers panel by clicking and draging them from the Datasets panel to the desired position in the Layers panel. </p>
<h3>Working with Multiple Layers</h3>
<p>Multiple layers can be added at once using the standard windows operations of &quot;Shift-Click&quot; and &quot;Ctrl+Click&quot;.</p>
<p>To select a continuous group of layers, select the first layer by clicking on it, then holding the &quot;Shift&quot; key down, click on the last layer in the group. </p>
<p>To select a discontinuous group of layers, select the first layer by clicking on it, then while holding the &quot;Ctrl&quot; key down, click on each layer you want to add to the group. </p>
<p>The selected group of layers can now be moved, added to or removed from the Layers panel, or turned on or off.</p>
<table width="200" border="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center"><img src="../images/layers_bulk_selection.png" alt="Selecting Multiple Layers - Shift Click" width="297" height="347" border="1" /><br />
        <em>Shift + Click to select multiple layers</em></div></td>
    <td><p align="center"><img src="../images/layers_multiple_selection.png" alt="Selecting Multiple Layers - Ctrl Click" width="297" height="347" border="1" /><em>Ctrl + Click to select multiple layers</em><br />
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Remove Layers from the Layers panel</h3>
<p>Layers can be removed from the Layers panel by selecting the layer in the Layers panel and then clicking the <img src="../images/button_delete.png" alt="Delete Button" width="23" height="23" align="absmiddle" />delete button. Multiple layers and Collections can also be deleted from the Layers panel using this button.</p>
<p>Layers can also be removed from the Layers panel by clicking the <img src="../images/button_remove.png" alt="Remove Button" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" /> remove button next to the required layer.</p>
