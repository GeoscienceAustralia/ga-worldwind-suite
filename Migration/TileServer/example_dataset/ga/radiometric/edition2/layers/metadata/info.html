2nd Edition - 2010</h2>
<p><b>EXPLANATORY NOTES</b><br> The ternary radiometric image
shows the concentrations of the radioelements potassium (K), uranium (U)
and thorium (Th) at the Earth's surface as measured using the airborne
gamma-ray spectrometric method. The image is a false colour composite
using the colours red, blue and green to represent potassium, uranium
and thorium, respectively. These primary colours are mixed in the same
proportions at each point on the map as the concentrations of the
radioelements. Thus white areas have high concentrations of all the
radioelements and dark areas have low concentrations. Areas high in K
only appear red, and areas high in U and Th but low in K appear
turquoise (a mixture of green and blue). So this representation of the
data is useful for viewing the concentrations of all three radioelements
in a single image. 
<br>
</p>
<p>The distribution of the radioelements reflects the geochemistry
and mineralogy of bedrock and regolith materials. K, U and Th
precipitate late in the igneous and volcanic crystallisation sequence.
Thus felsic igneous and volcanic equivalents are usually high in these
elements and mafic rocks low. A general increase in K, U and Th with
increasing bedrock silica content is usually observed. Surface
weathering modifies the distribution of these elements, and their
concentration in weathered material can differ significantly from fresh
bedrock. K is often leached from highly weathered bedrock, whereas U and
Th are retained by association with resistate minerals, clay and oxides
in the weathering profile.</p>
<p>The airborne gamma-ray spectrometric data used to compile this
map were acquired by Geoscience Australia and State and Territory
Geological Surveys over a period of about 40 years. During this period
there were significant changes in the technology and techniques used to
estimate the radioelement concentrations. As a result, the radiometric
survey data were not all registered to the same baseline. To solve this
problem, Geoscience Australia commissioned UTS Geophysics Pty Ltd to
conduct an Australia-wide Airborne Geophysical Survey (AWAGS) to be used
to establish a consistent radioelement baseline for Australia.</p>
<p>The survey was funded under the Australian Government's Onshore
Energy Security Program with the flying phase of the survey completed in
December 2007 and the final processed radiometric data delivered in June
2008. The survey covers the entire continent with north-south flight
lines spaced 75 km apart, and east-west tie lines spaced 400 km apart <em>(see Figure 1)</em>.
Gamma-ray spectrometric data, acquired at a nominal 80 metre terrain
clearance along the flight lines, was processed to be consistent with an
international baseline established by the International Atomic Energy
Agency. The final estimates of the radioelement concentrations along the
survey lines comprise the new Australian radioelement baseline.</p>
<p>The radiometric data contained in the National Airborne
Geophysical Database have been levelled to the new baseline by
minimising both the differences in radioelement concentration estimates
between surveys (where these surveys overlap) and the differences
between the surveys and the AWAGS traverses (where these overlap) using
an enhancement of the method described by Minty (2000).</p>

<p>This edition of the Radiometric Map of Australia
		has been produced from 600 individual survey grids that have been
		matched and merged into composite K, U and Th grids over Australia at
		100 metre resolution. The data are from surveys flown by Geoscience
		Australia, and surveys flown under contract to Geoscience Australia
		and the State and Territory Geological Surveys. The source data are
		used with their permission. The surveys were flown with a range of
		line spacings <em>(see Figure 2)</em>, flying heights, and
measurement accuracies (Percival, 2010).</p>
<p>Data was supplied by: Geoscience Australia; Department of Industry and Investment, New South Wales; Department of Primary Industries,
    Victoria;  Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation (DEEDI), Queensland; Department of
    Primary Industries and Resources, South Australia; Department of Mines and Petroleum,  Western Australia; Department of Infrastructure, Energy
    and Resources, Tasmania; and the Department of Resources, Northern Territory. Most of
    the data were acquired at an altitude of 100 metre or less along lines
    spaced 500 metre apart or less.</p>
<p>For each of K, U and Th, individual surveys were gridded using a
cell size of approximately one-fifth of the survey line spacing, with
some grids subjected to micro-levelling (Minty, 1991). The grids were
levelled to the AWAGS baseline, as described earlier, and then low-pass
filtered using a 7-point, degree-3 Savitzky-Golay filter (Savitzky and
Golay, 1964). K, U and Th merged grids were created by interpolating
each survey grid onto a regular grid with a cell size of 3.75 seconds of
arc using the minimum curvature method of Briggs (1974), and the grid
boundaries seamlessly feathered (Minty, 2000). The final grids were then
reprojected to the Lambert Conformal Conic projection with a cell size
of 100 metre. For imaging purposes, concentrations were normalised to a
0-255 range through histogram equalisation.</p>
