<p><b>Ternary</b><br>
K-Th-U ternary is an RGB image with dimensionless units. The NE gradient
has been enhanced (dose) and the histogram equalised for area.</p>
<p><b>Dose rate</b><br>
Air-absorbed dose due to K, Th and U. The measurments used are nG/hr.
The histogram has been equalised using the rain2 look-up table.</p>
<p><b>Potasium</b><br>
Potassium (K) radioelement concentrations uses % potassium as the
measurment. The histogram has been equalised using the rain2 look-up
table.</p>
<p><b>Thorium</b><br>
Thorium (Th) radioelement concentrations uses ppm equivalent thorium as
the measurment. The histogram has been equalised using the rain2 look-up
table.</p>
<p><b>Uranium</b><br>
Uranium (U) radioelement concentrations uses ppm equivalent uranium as
the measurment. The histogram has been equalised using the rain2 look-up
table.</p>
<p><b>Uranium/Potassium Ratio (U-K Ratio)</b><br>
Ratio of uranium over potassium radioelement concentrations. The
histogram has been equalised using the rain2 look-up table.</p>
<p><b>Thorium/Potassium Ratio (K-Th Ratio)</b><br>
Ratio of thorium over potassium radioelement concentrations. The
histogram has been equalised using the rain2 look-up table.</p>
<p><b>Uranium/Thorium Ratio (Th-U Ratio)</b><br>
Ratio of uranium over thorium radioelement concentrations. The histogram
has been equalised using the rain2 look-up table.</p>
<p><b>EXPLANATORY NOTES:</b><br>
The ternary radiometric image shows the concentrations of the
radioelements potassium (K), uranium (U) and thorium (Th) at the Earth's
surface as measured using the airborne gamma-ray spectrometric method.
The image is a false colour composite using the colours red, blue and
green to represent potassium, uranium and thorium, respectively. These
primary colours are mixed in the same proportions at each point on the
map as the concentrations of the radioelements. Thus white areas have
high concentrations of all the radioelements and dark areas have low
concentrations. Areas high in K only appear red, and areas high in U and
Th but low in K appear turquoise (a mixture of green and blue). So this
representation of the data is useful for viewing the concentrations of
all three radioelements in a single image.<br>
</p>
<p>The distribution of the radioelements reflects the geochemistry
and mineralogy of bedrock and regolith materials. K, U and Th
precipitate late in the igneous and volcanic crystallisation sequence.
Thus felsic igneous and volcanic equivalents are usually high in these
elements and mafic rocks low. A general increase in K, U and Th with
increasing bedrock silica content is usually observed. Surface
weathering modifies the distribution of these elements, and their
concentration in weathered material can differ significantly from fresh
bedrock. K is often leached from highly weathered bedrock, whereas U and
Th are retained by association with resistate minerals, clay and oxides
in the weathering profile.</p>
<p>The airborne gamma-ray spectrometric data used to compile this
map were acquired by Geoscience Australia and State and Territory
Geological Surveys over a period of about 40 years. During this period
there were significant changes in the technology and techniques used to
estimate the radioelement concentrations. As a result, the radiometric
survey data were not all registered to the same baseline. To solve this
problem, Geoscience Australia commissioned UTS Geophysics Pty Ltd to
conduct an Australia-wide Airborne Geophysical Survey (AWAGS) to be used
to establish a consistent radioelement baseline for Australia.</p>
<p>The survey was funded under the Australian Government's Onshore
Energy Security Program with the flying phase of the survey completed in
December 2007 and the final processed radiometric data delivered in June
2008. The survey covers the entire continent with north-south flight
lines spaced 75 km apart, and east-west tie lines spaced 400 km apart.
Gamma-ray spectrometric data, acquired at a nominal 80 metre terrain
clearance along the flight lines, was processed to be consistent with an
international baseline established by the International Atomic Energy
Agency. The final estimates of the radioelement concentrations along the
survey lines comprise the new Australian radioelement baseline.</p>
<p>The radiometric data contained in the National Airborne
Geophysical Database have been levelled to the new baseline by
minimising both the differences in radioelement concentration estimates
between surveys (where these surveys overlap) and the differences
between the surveys and the AWAGS traverses (where these overlap) using
an enhancement of the method described by Minty (2000).</p>
<p>This edition of the Radiometric Map of Australia has been
produced from 558 individual survey grids that have been matched and
merged into composite K, U and Th grids over Australia at 100 metre
resolution. The data are from surveys flown by Geoscience Australia, and
surveys flown under contract to Geoscience Australia and the State and
Territory Geological Surveys. The source data are used with their
permission. The surveys were flown with a range of line spacings (see
source diagram), flying heights, and measurement accuracies (Percival,
2008).</p>
<p>Data was supplied by: Geoscience Australia; New South Wales
Department of Primary Industries; Department of Primary Industries
Victoria; Department of Mines and Energy Queensland; Department of
Primary Industries and Resources South Australia; Department of Industry
and Resources Western Australia; Department of Infrastructure, Energy
and Resources Tasmania; and the Department of Regional Development,
Primary Industry, Fisheries and Resources Northern Territory. Most of
the data were acquired at an altitude of 100 metre or less along lines
spaced 500 metre apart or less.</p>
<p>For each of K, U and Th, individual surveys were gridded using a
cell size of approximately one-fifth of the survey line spacing, with
some grids subjected to micro-levelling (Minty, 1991). The grids were
levelled to the AWAGS baseline, as described earlier, and then low-pass
filtered using a 7-point, degree-3 Savitzky-Golay filter (Savitzky and
Golay, 1964). K, U and Th merged grids were created by interpolating
each survey grid onto a regular grid with a cell size of 3.75 seconds of
arc using the minimum curvature method of Briggs (1974), and the grid
boundaries seamlessly feathered (Minty, 2000). The final grids were then
reprojected to the Lambert Conformal Conic projection with a cell size
of 100 metre. For imaging purposes, concentrations were normalised to a
0-255 range through histogram equalisation.</p>
