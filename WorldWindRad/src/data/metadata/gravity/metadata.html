<p><b>EXPLANATORY NOTES:</b><br>
This image is derived from observations recorded at approximately 1.4
million gravity stations held in the Australian National Gravity
Database (ANGD) by Geoscience Australia (GA), and free-air gravity
anomaly data derived from satellite altimetry by Sandwell and Smith
(1997) over marine areas. The onshore data were aquired by the
Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, the mining and
exploration industry, universities and research organisations from the
1950s to the present day. Continental Australia has a basic station
spacing coverage of 11 kilometres, with South Australia, Tasmania and
part of New South Wales covered at a spacing of 7 kilometres. <br>
</p>
<p>Victoria has station coverage of approximately 1.5 kilometres.
Recent Federal, State and Territory Government initiatives have funded
systematic infill at a grid station spacing of 2, 2.5 or 4 kilometres to
provide improved coverage in areas of scientific or economic interest.
Other areas of detailed coverage have been surveyed by private companies
for exploration purposes. Over the continental region only open file
data as held in the ANGD at May 2008 were used in the creation of the
grid. The diagram below shows the distribution of these onshore
stations. Data derived from satellite altimetry were used over the
marine region.</p>
<p>In both images spherical cap Bouguer gravity anomalies are shown
onshore while free-air anomalies are shown offshore. The gravity
anomalies are based on the Australian Absolute Gravity Datum 2007 and
1994 Geodetic Datum of Australia (Tracey et al., 2008).</p>
<p>The onshore Bouguer gravity anomalies were calculated using a
density of 2.67 tm¯³. Offshore free-air gravity anomalies were based on
gravity (V16.1) and topography (V9.1) data extracted from the Marine
Gravity from Satellite Altimetry dataset (Sandwell and Smith, 1997,
2005). These data were combined with the GA onshore gravity data and
gridded using a variable density gridding technique provided by the
INTREPID Geophysics software package. The data were gridded to a cell
size of 800 metres using Lambert Conic Conformal Projection coordinates
with standard parallels of 18° and 36° south and a central meridian of
134° east.</p>
<p>The large image shows Bouguer gravity anomalies onshore and
free-air gravity anomalies offshore after applying a high-pass filter
with a cut-off wavelength of 500 kilometres. The image below is of the
gravity data without the application of the filter.</p>
<p>In both the large and small images, to emphasize the expression
of subtle anomalies, an artificial sun-angle "illumination" from the
northeast was used to modify both the saturation and intensity of the
original colour image.</p>
<p>The geodetic version of the grid used for the preparation of the
image and the original onshore point located data are available online
from Geoscience Australia at: http://www.geoscience.gov.au/gadds.</p>
