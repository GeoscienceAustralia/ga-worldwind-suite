<p><b>PREFACE:</b><br>
This edition of the Magnetic Anomaly Map of Australia results from a
completely new compilation of Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) grid data.
It has been produced using a new method of matching the individual
survey grids and the use of independent data to help constrain long
wavelengths. 680 individual grids have been matched and merged into the
composite used to produce this image, with the resolution of each grid
optimal for the specifications of the source survey line data. Since the
Third Edition (Milligan and Tarlowski,1999), data from many new surveys
have been added, acquired mainly by the State and Territory geological
surveys. It is estimated that 19 million line-kilometres of survey data
were acquired to produce the grid data, 10 million line-kilometres more
than for the third edition. <br>

<p><b>EXPLANATORY NOTES:</b><br>
This image was compiled from Total Magnetic Intensity survey data held
in the National Airborne Geophysical Database by Geoscience Australia.
The image is a composite of data acquired from surveys flown by
Geoscience Australia, and surveys flown under contract to Geoscience
Australia, the State and Territory geological surveys in either separate
or joint projects and the private sector. The source data are used with
their permission. The data from these surveys were acquired at a range
of line spacings (see source diagrams), flying heights, and measurement
accuracies (Richardson, 2004). The map also incorporates marine magnetic
data from research surveys by Geoscience Australia (Petkovic and
Milligan, 2002) and foreign institutions. <br>
</p>
<p>The data supplied by the New South Wales Department of Primary
Industries; Department of Business, Industry and Resources Development
Northern Territory; Natural Resources and Mines Queensland; Department
of Primary Industries and Resources South Australia; Department of
Infrastructure, Energy and Resources Tasmania; Department of Primary
Industries Victoria and Department of Industry and Resources Western
Australia (see source diagram) were acquired at an altitude of 100 m or
less along lines spaced 500 m apart or less.</p>
<p>For each survey, the International Geomagnetic Reference Field
for the relevant epoch was removed, and a grid created with a cell size
of approximately one fifth of the survey line spacing, using the minimum
curvature method of Briggs (1974). Some grids were subjected to
micro-levelling (Minty, 1991). The gridded data from all the surveys
were joined together using a two-stage method, based on the data
differences in the overlap regions between adjacent surveys. Initially,
a base-shift was applied to each survey to minimise the global set of
differences between adjacent surveys. An iterative process was then
applied, removing a plane surface from selected surveys to minimise the
differences between it and its neighbours.</p>
<p>During this iterative process, the base levels of those grids
that overlapped with an independent dataset, the Australia Wide Array of
Geomagnetic Stations (AWAGS) airborne magnetic data, were constrained by
the AWAGS data, to help improve the accuracy of long wavelength
information (Minty et al, 2003; Milligan et al, 2001). Remaining
high-frequency differences between the grids were smoothed out using a
convolution operator. The final grid was created by interpolating all of
the data into one grid, with a cell size of 7.2 seconds of arc, which
was then reprojected to the Lambert Conformal Conic projection with a
cell size of 250 m.</p>
<p>The image was generated from the natural colour palette (magenta
high - blue low) using histogram equalisation. To emphasise the
expression of short-wavelength anomalies, an artificial illumination was
applied from the northeast. The output of the sun-angle image was used
to modulate the colour intensity and saturation of the initial colour
image in the Hue, Saturation, Value colour space (Milligan et al, 1992)
