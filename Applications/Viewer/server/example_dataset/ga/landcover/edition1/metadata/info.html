<p><strong>About Dynamic Land Cover</strong><br>
Land cover is the observed  biophysical cover on the Earth&rsquo;s surface. This includes native vegetation, soils,  exposed rocks and water bodies as well as anthropogenic elements such as  plantations, crops and built environments.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Remote sensing data  recorded over a period of time allows the observation of land cover change over  time or &lsquo;dynamic land cover&rsquo;.&nbsp; A key  aspect of land cover is &lsquo;greenness&rsquo; in vegetation. Greenness is directly  related to the amount of photosynthesis occurring, and can be measured as an index  such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (Huete <em>et al.</em> 2002)</p>
<p>The Dynamic Land Cover Map  presents land cover information for every 250m by 250m area of the country from  April 2000 to April 2008. The classification scheme used to describe land cover  categories in the Dynamic Land Cover Map conforms to the 2007 International  Standards Organisation (ISO) land cover standard (19144-2).&nbsp; The Dynamic Land Cover Map shows Australian  land covers clustered into 34 ISO classes. These reflect the structural  character of vegetation, ranging from cultivated and managed land covers (crops  and pastures) to natural land covers such as closed forest and sparse, open  grasslands. </p>
<p>Information about dynamic  land cover is critical for informed land management, and is increasingly required  at national, state and regional levels with annual or monthly updates. The Dynamic  Land Cover Map addresses the need for a single, nationally consistent and  complete land cover reference for Australia,  and provides a base-line for reporting on change and trends in vegetation cover  and extent.</p>
<p><strong>Development of the Dynamic   Land Cover Map</strong><br />
The source data for the Dynamic  Land Cover Map is a time series of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data from the  Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites  operated by NASA. The time series includes 186 snapshots of vegetation  greenness for each 250m by 250m area across the continent over a 10 year period.  &nbsp;An example of the time series displayed  by different land cover types is shown in <em>Figure  1</em></p>
<p>The EVI time series for  each 250m by 250m area was characterised using 12 time series coefficients that  describe its statistical, phenological and seasonal characteristics of the land  cover. A clustering approach was applied to the 12 coefficients to define  homogenous regions with similar greenness dynamics over time. &nbsp;Regions sharing similar time series  coefficients were labelled using information derived from the 2009 Catchment  Land Use Maps dataset and Native Vegetation Information System dataset provided  by the Bureau of Rural Sciences.</p>
<p>Initial results were  presented to a workshop of state and federal stakeholders from across Australia  in September 2009. Feedback from the workshop was used to revise the cluster labels.  The labelling was further refined by comparison with Photosynthetically Active  Radiation data from CSIRO Land  and Water and Foliage Projective Cover data from the Queensland Statewide  Landcover and Tree Study program. Terrain effects were addressed by using digital  elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Accuracy<br />
</strong>State agencies provided  more 25,000 field validation sites to assess the accuracy of Dynamic Land Cover  Map.&nbsp; As land cover classes are not generally  clear-cut, but merge gradually from one to the other, a fuzzy-logic system (Zhang  and Foody, 1998) was used to compare the 34 Dynamic Land Cover Map classes with  the field data on a sliding scale.&nbsp; The  classes of the sliding scale are: exact match such as <em>trees open</em> vs <em>trees open</em>,  very similar such as <em>trees open</em> vs <em>trees scattered</em>, moderately similar as  in <em>trees open</em> vs <em>shrubs open</em>, somewhat similar as in <em>trees open</em> vs <em>shrubs closed</em>,  and complete mismatch as in <em>trees open</em> vs <em>irrigated graminoids</em>.&nbsp; The match between the field data and the Dynamic  Land Cover Map was exact in 30% of cases, very similar in 35% of cases, moderately  similar in 10% of cases, somewhat similar in 18% of cases and a complete  mismatch in 7% of cases. &nbsp;These results  show a high degree of consistency between the Dynamic Land Cover Map and extensive  independent field-based datasets.</p>
