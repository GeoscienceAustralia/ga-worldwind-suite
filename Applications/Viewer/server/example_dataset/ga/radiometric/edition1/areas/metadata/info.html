<h3 align="center">COLOUR-ENHANCED AREAS</h3>
<p><i>The colour-enhanced areas have been reprocessed to highlight the high
and low values within each area. Values for each area have been normalised
locally, so highs and lows cannot be compared to other regions. See the
national data for comparitive values. Use the <b>Fly to</b> dropdown
menu to select the area to view.</i></p>

<p><b>Bathurst/Orange Region - New South Wales</b><br> The
region lies within the Lachlan Fold Belt and includes
Ordovician-Silurian meta-volcanics and Silurian-Devonian metasediments
and granites (red and white hues). These rocks have undergone multiple
episodes of regional deformation and hydrothermal alteration leading to
a high degree of structural and lithological complexity. Tertiary basalt
flows are also scattered throughout the region (dark hues). Landforms
range from broad, low relief depositional plains of the Lachlan and
Macquarie floodplains to steeply-incised hills. Areas of relatively deep
weathering occur in green hues. 
</p>

<p><b>Central Uplands - Victoria</b><br> The area consists of
variably-weathered and fractured Palaeozoic meta-sedimentary and
granitic bedrock, Cainozoic basalt and alluvial and colluvial sediments.
Slightly to moderately weathered basement rocks typically appear in red
to white hues. Tertiary basalts appear in green and black hues. Green
hues (high Th) are also associated with highly weathered bedrock. Broard
alluvial and colluvial plains associated with the Murray Basin occur to
the north. 
</p>

<p><b>Flinders Ranges - South Australia</b><br> The Flinders
Ranges are largely composed of folded and faulted sediments of the
Adelaide Geosyncline. Sediments were deposited in a large basin during
the Neoproterozoic. During the Cambrian, approximately 540 million years
ago, the area underwent the Delamerian orogeny where the geosynclinal
sequence was folded and faulted into a large mountain range. Since this
time the area has undergone erosion resulting in the relatively low
ranges today. White and pink hues area associated with
arkosic/feldspathic sandstones and siltstones. Ridges of quartzite
appear in black hues (low in all three radioelements). 
</p>

<p><b>Pilbara Region - Western Australia</b><br> The Archaean
Pilbara Craton of northwestern Western Australia consists of
granitoid-greenstone terrain (3.6-2.8Ga). Rocks include granite (white
and red hues), basalts and ultra-mafics lithologies (black hues).
Overlying sediments associated with the Canning Basin consist of aeolian
sands, sandstone and conglomerate (east of image in black and green
hues). Extensive alluvial and colluvial plains in reddish hues occur
between the granitiod- reenstone terrain and the coast. This relatively
well exposed province is an excellent example of how airborne gamma-ray
spectrometry can be used to map bedrock types (including zonation within
the granites) and structures. 
</p>

<p><b>Macdonnell Ranges - Central Australia</b><br> The
Macdonnell Ranges consist of folded Palaeozoic and Neoproterozoic
sediments including sandstone, siltstone, quartzite, dolostone, chert
and conglomerate. These rocks overlay Mesoproterozoic and
Palaeoprotozoic crystalline basement rocks of the Arunta Block. The
latter lithologies include; gabbro, high grade metamorphic, gneiss and
granite. In the central western sector of imagea circular feature
associated with the Glosses Bluff impact crater is clearly visible.
Sedimentary siliciclastic rocks – sandstone, conglomerate, mudstone and
quartzite appear in black hues (low in all three radioelements)..High
grade metamorphic rocks and deformed granite appear in whitish hues.
Alluvial and colluvial sediments apper in red to greenish blue hues. 
</p>

<p><b>Musgrave Range - Central Australia</b><br> The Musgrave
block consists of Proterozoic ultra mafic and felsic rocks including
gabbro, pyroxenite, norite, dolerite, granites, ademellite, gneiss and
granulites. Extensive depositional plains consisting of dune fields,
colluvium and alluvium surround the ranges. Gneiss, granite and
adamellite appear in reddish/white hues. Minor Gabbro and dolerite
appear black in image. Actively deposited floodplain sediments appear in
white hues and ferruginous lags are typically associated with shades of
green (elevated Th). 
</p>

<p><b>Mount Isa Region - Queensland</b><br> The Mount Isa
Inlier consists of early and middle Proterozoic rocks. Lithologies
include meta- sedimentary siliciclastic rocks, granite, metabasalt,
diorite, gabbro, dacite and rhyolite. Quartz rich sedimentart bedrock
and mafic lithologies appear in black hues. Felsic rocks typically coour
in red- white hues. Extensive Cainozoic sediments surround these rocks
and consist of alluvial and colluvial sands, clays and gravels. The
gamma-ray image can be use to highlight active areas of deposition
(white to red hues) from older floodplain sediments (greenish-black
hues). Highly weathered sediments and granite are often associated with
elevated Th (green hues). 
</p>

<p><b>North East Region - Tasmania</b><br>The north east
uplands of Tasmania consist of Lower Devonian sedimentary bedrock
intruded by Lower Carboniferous – Devonian Granites. Tertiary flood
basalts are still preserved in valley floors. Landforms are strongly
dissected with moderate to high relief. Alluvial and colluvial sediments
are associated with the coastal depositional plains. Slightly weathered
granites apppear mainly in white hues and constrasts highly weathered
granite in green hues (elevated Th). Tertiary basalts are delineated in
green-blue hues. Quartzite rich sedimentary bedrock typically exhibit
low radioelement concentrations and appear in dark brown to black in the
image. Quaternary alluvial sands and gravels typically have a high K
response suggesting that these sediments are sourced (at least in part)
from weathered granitic rocks.
