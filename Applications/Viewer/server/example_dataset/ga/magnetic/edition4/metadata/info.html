4th Edition, 2004</h2>
<p><b>PREFACE:</b><br> This edition of the Magnetic Anomaly Map
of Australia results from a completely new compilation of Total Magnetic
Intensity (TMI) grid data. It has been produced using a new method of
matching the individual survey grids and the use of independent data to
help constrain long wavelengths. 680 individual grids have been matched
and merged into the composite used to produce this image, with the
resolution of each grid optimal for the specifications of the source
survey line data. Since the Third Edition (Milligan and Tarlowski,
1999), data from many new surveys have been added, acquired mainly by
the State and Territory geological surveys. It is estimated that 19
million line-kilometres of survey data were acquired to produce the grid
data, 10 million line-kilometres more than for the third edition. 
</p>
<p><b>EXPLANATORY NOTES:</b><br> This image was compiled from
Total Magnetic Intensity survey data held in the National Airborne
Geophysical Database by Geoscience Australia. The image is a composite
of data acquired from surveys flown by Geoscience Australia, and surveys
flown under contract to Geoscience Australia, the State and Territory
geological surveys in either separate or joint projects and the private
sector. The source data are used with their permission. The data from
these surveys were acquired at a range of line spacings (see diagrams
below), flying heights, and measurement accuracies (Richardson, 2004).
The map also incorporates marine magnetic data from research surveys by
Geoscience Australia (Petkovic and Milligan, 2002) and foreign
institutions.

Industries; Department of Business, Industry and Resources Development
Northern Territory; Natural Resources and Mines Queensland; Department
of Primary Industries and Resources South Australia; Department of
Infrastructure, Energy and Resources Tasmania; Department of Primary
Industries Victoria and Department of Industry and Resources Western
Australia (see diagram below) were acquired at an altitude of 100 m or
less along lines spaced 500 m apart or less.</p>

<p>For each survey, the International Geomagnetic Reference Field
for the relevant epoch was removed, and a grid created with a cell size
of approximately one fifth of the survey line spacing, using the minimum
curvature method of Briggs (1974). Some grids were subjected to
micro-levelling (Minty, 1991). The gridded data from all the surveys
were joined together using a two-stage method, based on the data
differences in the overlap regions between adjacent surveys. Initially,
a base-shift was applied to each survey to minimise the global set of
differences between adjacent surveys. An iterative process was then
applied, removing a plane surface from selected surveys to minimise the
differences between it and its neighbours. During this iterative
process, the base levels of those grids that overlapped with an
independent dataset, the Australia Wide Array of Geomagnetic Stations
(AWAGS) airborne magnetic data, were constrained by the AWAGS data, to
help improve the accuracy of long wavelength information (Minty et al,
2003; Milligan et al, 2001). Remaining high-frequency differences
between the grids were smoothed out using a convolution operator. The
final grid was created by interpolating all of the data into one grid,
with a cell size of 7.2 seconds of arc, which was then reprojected to
the Lambert Conformal Conic projection with a cell size of 250 m.</p>

high - blue low) using histogram equalisation. To emphasise the
expression of short-wavelength anomalies, an artificial illumination was
applied from the northeast. The output of the sun-angle image was used
to modulate the colour intensity and saturation of the initial colour
image in the Hue, Saturation, Value colour space (Milligan et al, 1992).</p>
