<!-- ### Introduction ### -->
<a name="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<p>The World Wind Animator was written so that <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/">Geoscience Australia</a> could create fly-through footage showing geological information for use as a visual communication tool. The animator was developed using <a href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/">NASA's World Wind Java SDK</a>, as an addition to the 3D Data Viewer developed by GA to display Australia's continental data sets.</p>

<p>The Data sets used by the Animator are rather large; Each can take up several Terabytes of space. As such the default data sets are stored on remote servers, located at Geoscience and NASA. The World Wind Animator only accesses the data as it needs to, pulling the required data down over the network and caching it as the camera brings it into view.</p>

<p>Objects within a scene have parameters that can be animated, using the concept of a keyframe to change the parameters values over time. Parameters differ from object to object, but examples include a camera's positional parameters and a layers opacity.</p>

<p><a href="#TOC">Top</a><p>

<!-- ### Interface ### -->
<a name="UI"><h2>Interface</h2></a>

<p>Visually, The dominate feature of the Animator is the viewport. On opening it should display a view of the earth from space. The viewport shows the camera's current view. To the left of the viewport is a panel containing three rollouts. The Animation Browser, a list of all objects in the animation; Properties, a rollout that displays all of the selected objects properties; and Layer Palette, a list of all of the standard layers that can be added into the scene. These are used to interact with layers. Below the viewport is the time slider; A drag bar marking a position on a number line. This is used to mark the time a property changes, while animating.</p>

<a href="images/AnimatorFirstOpen.png"><img src="images/AnimatorFirstOpen.png" width="465.85" height="246.05"></a>

<p>The viewport has crosshairs in the centre. These mark the target location on the ground, where the camera is looking. In order to move that location, drag the mouse around the viewport while holding the left mouse button down. This can also be achieved with the arrow buttons on the keyboard. This is called Panning the camera. It is important to note that the camera does not pan relative to it's own position, as one might expect. It instead pans the position relevant to the ground, effectively keeping the camera target on the ground.</p>

<p>Zooming can be achieved in two ways. First, the mouse wheel can be spun, moving the camera toward or away from the earth in increments. This is not a smooth process; the camera jumps up and down as the wheel moves. In order to zoom smoothly the mouse wheel can be used as a middle mouse button. Holding it down while moving the mouse up and down will zoom the camera smoothly, forward and backward.</p>

<p>To change the angle of the camera, hold the right mouse button down and drag the mouse around the viewport. Doing this will rotate the camera around the target, which is marked by the crosshairs in middle of the viewport.</p>

<p>There are several overlays which may be visible on the viewport. The camera target crosshairs, the grid and the rule of thirds. These can be turned on or off in the Animation menu.</p>

<p>When resizing the window, The viewport will not deform; The rendered image will always keep it's aspect ratio. If the window is expanded, it will leave empty space, which can create a letterbox effect. It is also impossible to shrink the window past the render size. There is a <em>Resize to render dimensions</em> option in the Animation menu. This shrinks the window back to the correct size and aspect ratio.</p>

<!-- ### Layers and Objects ### -->
<a name="layers"><h2>Objects and Layers</h2></a>

<a href="images/AnimationPanel.png"><img src="images/AnimationPanel.png" align="left" height="535.5" width="259.25"></a>

<p>In the World Wind Animator the earth is made up of different data sets. The top rollout in the side panel, labelled <em>Animation Browser</em>, contains a list of the different objects within the scene that make up the animation.</p>

<p>Each list item, listed under the World Wind Animator, has two or three buttons, an icon and a name: An expand button, like the one in windows explorer, which either expands or collapses properties belonging to the object in the list item; A checkbox, marking whether or not the object is currently active; A coloured letter <font class="em">a</font> in a circle, marking whether or not the item is armed; An icon that indicates what kind of object the list item is; and the name.</p>

<p>When an object is armed, new keyframes can be created for the object. This is discussed further in the animation chapter.</p>

<img src="images/ObjectIcons.png" align="center">

<p>
There are several types of object in the animator. Animatable objects (such as the camera), Elevation objects and models, data Layers and animatable properties. The object's icon shows what the object is. If the icon is made up of three balls, the one in front being blue and the others being faded, then it is an animatable object. If that icon has a red <font class="em">L</font> in the foreground, then it an animatable layer. If the letter is an <font class="em">E</font>, then it is an elevation layer. If the icon has a single blue ball with the number <font class="code">001</font> underneath it, then it is an animatable property. If the Icon is a light gray circle with a jagged line, then it is an elevation model.</p>

<p>Expanding an object displays any properties the object has in the list. This can be useful for enabling/disabling different properties in an object, such as the camera's clipping properties.</p>

<p>The animation browser has it's own toolbar, at the top of the rollout. It allows the removal of an object from the list; Repositioning of an object in the list; The mass enabling/disabling and arming/disarming of objects.</p>

<p>The order the layers affects how they are displayed. If the layer <em>Landsat</em> is below the layer <em>Blue Marble</em> in the list, and it's opacity is set to .5, then the world image is blended 50/50 between the Blue Marble Layer and the Landsat layer. If however, The Blue Marble layer is below the Landsat layer, then there will be no visible difference, as each item on the list is overlaid onto the previous layer. Note that the Landsat layer is not visible from space.</p>

<p>Layers can have multiple properties. At the time of writing the camera has eight different properties. When an object is selected in the animation browser, any properties it has are displayed in the properties rollout. If the object is itself a property, then it is displayed in the properties rollout. Changes to the properties values can be animated.</p>

<a name="addingLayers"><h3>Adding Layers</h3></a>

<p>Layers are specified in XML files. They contain information about the layer's type, where to get any data and how to interpret any data referenced. New layers can either be added to the scene by dragging a layer file into the Animation Browser, or through the Layer Palette.</p>

<p>The layer palette, bellow the Properties rollout, contains a list of known layers that can be added to the animation. The layers currently in the scene are marked with a yellow flag. In order to add a layer to the animation, there is a green plus button to the right of the rollouts toolbar, directly above the scrollbar on the right. The red <font class="em">x</font> in the layer palette toolbar removes layers from the pallet, not from the scene. The box with the arrow pointing into it is the add layer button, from an XML file.</p>

<a name="WMSB"><h3>WMS Browser</h3></a>

<a href="images/WMSBrowser.png"><img src="images/WMSBrowser.png" width="465" height="299"></a>

<p>The Web Map Service (WMS) is an open standard for georeferenced maps. The WMS Browser can be used to find new layers, and get the data from an external server. The browser contains three windows: A list of known servers; a description and a preview window. When you expand a server in the list, it will display all the layers that are available on that server. Selecting one of them will load a description and information about that layer, and an image preview in the preview window.</p>

<p>In order to find a new server, there is a green plus sign on the WMS Server list toolbar. Clicking on it brings up a search window; Along with some instructions it has a search bar and a results window. A query can either be made of different terms or of a direct URL to a server. Any results have a name, URL and description of the service provided by the server. To add the servers to the list, check them with the checkbox on the left, and press Ok. There are <em>check all</em> and <em>check none</em> buttons in the bottom left corner. </p>

<a href="images/SearchWMS.png"><img src="images/SearchWMS.png" height="348" width="465"></a>

<p>The layers provided by a server can not be imported directly into an animation. First, they must be saved as layers. Selecting a layer will activate the save button on the list panel. Once the layer has been saved as an XML file, it can be added into the the scene as described in the previous sections.</p>

<a name="elevation"<h3>Elevation Models</h3>

<A href="images/ElevationExaggeration.png"<img src="images/ElevationExaggeration.png" width="465" height="246"></a>

<p>The World Wind Animator also supports Digital Elevation Models (DEM). These are used to deform the the terrain model, causing mountain ranges to appear according to the data. In the Animation Browser, these can be seen as children of the <em>Elevation</em> object. By default, there is only one DEM applied to the scene's elevation: <em>Earth</em>, a DEM provided by NASA that covers all the terrain on the planet.</p>

<p>The DEM files that are recognised by the animator are part of the XML layer file specification. In the animation menu there is an <em>Add elevation model...</em> option. Once a file has been given to the animator, the model will be listed in the Animation Browser and the terrain will be updated.</p>

<p>In order to exaggerate the elevation, an exaggeration properties may be added to the elevation object. They can be added with the <em>Animation &rarr; Add elevation exaggerator...</em> A new dialog will pop up and ask for a Boundary and an Exaggeration; A Boundary is the height at which the Exaggeration property will be applied, and the exaggeration is the amount of exaggeration to apply, where 1.0 is normal, 0.0 is flat and 2.0 is double.</p>

<p>The Exaggerator property will be applied to all the DEMs and multiple Exaggerators can be used. If an exaggerator states that from 100.00m, the terrain will be exaggerated by 2.0, all the terrain points that are above 100.00m above sea level will have their position doubled. If there is then another exaggerator that states that from 200.00m, all the terrain will be exaggerated by 1.0, all terrain points above 200.00m will be set back to their regular scale. This allows exaggeration ranges to be set.</p>

<p><a href="#TOC">Top</a><p>

<!-- ### Animation ### -->
<a name="animation"><h2>Animation</h2></a>

<p>Animation is done by keyframing changes to parameters. Moving the camera changes it's positional parameters. The timeline at the bottom of the camera viewport displays the keyframes that make up the animation.</p>

<a name="keyframes"><h3>Keyframes</h3></a>

<p>The World Wind Animator supports keyframes; Specific frames which determine the overall animation. By default the timeslider only has one hundred frames. The number can be changed with the <em>Set frame count...</em> dialog, found in the Frame menu.</p>

<p>The <em>insert</em> button on the keyboard, or the <em>Frame &rarr; Add key</em> menu item, inserts a new keyframe for all armed objects. If an object is armed, the arm button will be green, any keyframe that can be applied to it will be. Unarmed objects, that have a red arm button, do not recieve keyframes. There is also an <em>Auto key</em> option in the Frame menu. While this is active, all changes made will to any armed parameters will automatically be keyed to the current frame.</p>

<p>Most of the animation within the animator will revolve around layer parameters. Most layers have an opacity layer, which is a value between 0 and 1 that represents how transparant or visible the layer is. In order to add a keyframe modifing a parameter, change the parameter and then add the new keyframe. The view may not update with the changes to the parameter until the the keyframe has been added.</p>

<p>Each keyframe will visibly appear on the timeslider as a red rectangle, marking which frames are keyed. These frames can be dragged along the time line, underneath the timeslider. Frames can also be copied. When the time slider is on a frame, the frame is highlighted blue. If the slider is on a keyframe, then the frame is highlighted green. While the timeslider is on a keyframe, it can be copied with the <em>Frame &rarr; Copy</em> menu option or the by pressing <em>Ctrl+C</em>. The <em>Frame &rarr; Copy</em> option or the <em>Ctrl+V</em> keyboard shortcut will then paste the copied frame to the current frame.</p>

<p>The number of frames an animation takes up can be changed. The <em>Scale animation...</em> option opens a dialog box that requests a scale factor. The default number, 1.0, is equivalent to 100%. If a larger number is given the animation is stretched out over a larger number of frames. If the number is smaller, then the animation is shrunk. 0.5 is equivalent to half, or 50%, and 2.0 is double, or 200% of the current number of frames. This does not change the number of frames in the animation, however.</p>

<p>Animation can be played back by pressing the spacebar or using the <em>Preview</em> option in the animation menu will play back the animation in the viewport, from the current position to the end. There are also <em>preview x2</em> and <em>preview x10</em> option. In addition to moving the timeslider to different frames, there are also <em>Previous</em>, <em>Next</em>, <em>First</em> and <em>Last</em> options, in the frame menu. First and Last are mapped to Period (.), Comma (,). Using shift as well gives First and Last keybindings. The Ctrl key causes them to jump by ten frames.</p>

<a name="camera"><h3>The Camera</h3></a>

<p>The camera is an animatable object within the scene. It is made up of an Eye, the camera itself, and a look at target. The look at target is always aligned to the ground, and the camera rotates around it. Each have latitude, longitude and zoom parameters. It also has additional parameters controlling stereo cameras and clipping which can be added to it from the animation menu. It can be moved as described in the Interface chapter, or the parameters can be manually changed.</p>

<a href="images/CameraPaths.png"><img src="images/CameraPaths.png" height="290" width="465"></a>

<p>When a keyframe has been added to the camera, the camera's position becomes visible in the viewport. Immediately after a keyframe has been inserted, a pink dot will appear in the center of the crosshairs. If the viewport is moved away from the camera's position, two dots, a blue and a pink one, should be visible. They will be joined by a dotted line. The blue dot represents the camera's eye, while the pink dot represents the target. The camera path can be turned off in the Animation menu.</p>

<p>When the camera has multiple keyframes, they will all be visible within the viewport, joined together by lines showing their trajectories. The lines colour will vary between blue, where the movement is slow, and red, where the movement is quick.</p>

<p>In the Animation menu, there is a <em>Smooth eye speed</em> option. It adjusts all of the eye's keyframes in order to smooth the time between each point. To do this it will slightly the frame positions and curves belonging to a key.</p>

<p>To edit keyframes, the position of the camera can be changed by either moving the camera and pressing the insert button, or by grabbing and moving the visual representation. You can grab both the camera and the target using the left mouse button and change their latitude and longitude, or with the right mouse button and change their height (the zoom parameter).</p>

<h4>Camera Clipping</h4>

The camera can have extra parameters added to it, including Stereoscopic cameras and clipping. These can be found in the animation menu. To turn on clipping select the <em>Animate camera clipping</em> option. Two new animatable parameters will be added to the camera, and can be animated like the other parameters.


<a name="parameterEditor"><h3>The Parameter Editor</h3></a>

<a href="images/ParameterEditor.png"><img src="images/ParameterEditor.png" height="249" width="465"></a>

<p>The parameter editor, found in the Window menu or by clicking <em>Ctrl+P</em>, shows the changes made to parameters between different keyframes as a graph. On the left is a list of all the parameters in the scene that can be displayed. The gray area to the right displays a graph, once a parameter is selected.</p>

<p>The line represents the value of the parameter, and each point along it is a keyframe. Each keyframe has one or two lines coming off it, each with its own handle. These lines are bezier handles. Moving them affects the curve of the line between the keys. By default each bezier handle controls both the input and the output direction of the key. This can be changed by right clicking on the key and choosing <em>bezier (unlocked)</em>. There is also a linear option, which takes the input and sends the output directly toward the previous/next key.</p>

<p>There are two lines that go vertical across all open graphs. The red line is positioned at the current frame and the blue line is the closest frame to the current mouse position. The parameters values at those points are shown at the bottom right of the graph.</p>

<p>Navigating a graph can be done by holding down the mouse wheel (middle mouse button) and dragging the mouse around a graph. Rolling the wheel zooms, or by using the buttons on the toolbar at the top of the window. In order to stay in line, all the graphs will zoom and pan together.</p>

<p><a href="#TOC">Top</a><p>

<!-- ### Rendering ### -->
<a name="rendering"><h2>Rendering</h2></a>

<p>Rendering is the process of creating a final film. In the animation menu, there are three options: <em>Render</em>, <em>Quick Render (detailed)</em> and <em>Quick Render (preview)</em>. The Quick Render functions ask for a filename and then render an image set from the current frame to the end of the range. If they already have a destination filename then the quick render will just overwrite existing files. The render button opens a dialog which asks for Dimensions, Level of Detail, Frame Range and destination.</p>

<a href="images/RenderDialog.png"><img src="images/RenderDialog.png" align="left"></a>

<p>The dimensions of the image to render are in pixels, and also correspond to the size of the animator viewport. If set to 640 by 480, then the viewport will shrink to that size when the render button is pressed. By default, the aspect ratio is locked, so that when either the width or height is changed, the other will change as well. The scale changes the output size. The render size is displayed next to the scale box.</p>

<p>The level of detail (LOD) setting determines at what distance which LOD will be displayed. The terrain is generated by similarly to applying a hightmap to a mesh. As the camera gets closer to the terrain, the geometry gets more detailed. The LOD setting modifies the distance used to modify the terrain. The higher the number, the more detailed the mesh will be at a distance.</p>

<p>The World Wind Animator currently only renders out image sets. The output field in the destination panel points to the common prefix of each image. If the output reads <font class="code">c:\temp\camera\frame_</font> and you are rendering a hundred frames, then each frame will be rendered in <font class="code">c:\temp\camera\</font> as <font class="code">frame_001.tga</font>, <font class="code">frame_002.tga...</font> Any non-existing directories listed in the output will be created. If a full path is not specified, it will attempt to save the files in the directory that the animator is run from.</p>

<a name="stero"><h3>Rendering in Stereo</h3></a>

<p>The illusion of a 3D image is commonly created in film with stereoscopic footage: Two separate images or film channels that are created from two slightly different eye positions, in order to the separation between the human eyes in binocular vision. The World Wind Animator allows rendering of stereoscopic footage, rendering from two extra cameras on either side of the one used for the viewport. To use the stereoscopic cameras, select the <em>Use stereo camera</em> option from the animation menu. This will add two new parameters to the camera: <em>Focal Length</em> and <em>Eye Separation</em>.</p>

<p>The Focal Length is the point in front of the camera that the two camera's lines of sight converge, and then Eye Separation is the distance between the two eyes. These two parameters can be edited as per other parameters, but there is also a <em>Dynamic Stereo parameters</em> option in the Animation menu, which is checked by default. It attempts to animate the parameters dynamically according to the position of terrain in order to keep the focus sane.</p>

<p>When setting file names for the stereo projection, it creates two directories using the prefix with _left and _right, and separates the video channels into these directories.</p>
